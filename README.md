Software Engineer & Tech Lead passionate about crafting elegant solutions to complex product and engineering challenges. Outside of tech, Iâ€™m an amateur photographer capturing stories through my lens and a hiker exploring the beauty of nature. These pursuits inspire creativity, resilience, and a fresh perspective in everything I do.
